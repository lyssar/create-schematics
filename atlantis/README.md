Atlantis is a mysterious place, hidden in a cave in the deep ocean and protected by a large undestroyable glass dome.
In the middle is the heart. The operations hub where all comes together and it is surrounded by buildings. Each of them has its own purpose and it seems that there is little but no room to live if not in one of the facilities.

The only entry is through a trainstation or if you brave enough over the nether hub if you can find this deeply hidden. The trainstation was once the glamorous entry to that mysterious place but over time vines and gras has grown over and its now more a shadow of its former self.
